# Gradle setup

## Creating a Gradle project

Setting up a Gradle project is fairly easy. A single command will provide you with the files and folder necessary.

- Run the command `./gradlew init`
- Explore the generated files
- Run the command `./gradlew projects`
- Observe the name of your root project
